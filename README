GNUduino - Arduino made with gEDA
www.jeffrey.co.in/projects/gnuduino

GNUduino is an Arduino board (Arduino Single-Sided Serial Board Version 3) redrawn using gEDA. GNUduino functions same as that of an Arduino board (It's just a clone of Arduino ). The main reason for a redesign using gEDA was to have complete freedom. The existing Arduino use a proprietary software for circuit and PCB design, which restricts user freedom.
